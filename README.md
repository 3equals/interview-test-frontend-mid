Bismillah.

Hello, previously I have replied to a message via email recruitment@velocitigroup.au regarding the deadline problem I am working on, because I only opened the email from your team after 5 hours had passed.

For tasks as follows:

- Assignment 1: sorry for assignment 1, I have never used a CMS like WordPress and its friends, therefore I did not do assignment 1. However, I will be very happy if later I can learn about CMS and other things related to assignment 1. Please sorry in advance
- Task 2 : https://github.com/Teddir/crud-nextjs-zustand-firebase/tree/task-2
- Task 3 : https://github.com/Teddir/crud-nextjs-zustand-firebase/tree/task-3

I would really appreciate any input or additions from you. Thank you for the time.
