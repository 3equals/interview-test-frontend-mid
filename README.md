**Position:**  
Mid-Senior Front End Developer

**Objective:**  
The purpose of this interview test is to assess your skills and proficiency in front end development, with a focus on utilizing front end frameworks, libraries, preprocessors, and open source CMS platforms. As a mid-senior candidate with strong commercial experience and expertise in JavaScript ES6, TypeScript, front end frameworks/libraries (Bootstrap, React, Vue, Angular, jQuery), preprocessors (Gulp), SEO, and Web Accessibility standards, you are expected to demonstrate mastery in these areas.

**Instructions:**

1.  You will have **24 hours** to complete the test from the time it is provided to you.
2.  Design your own website layout and structure based on the specified features and requirements.
3.  Utilize HTML5, CSS (with SCSS), JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript, and any front end frameworks or libraries of your choice (e.g., Bootstrap, React, Vue, Angular, jQuery) to build the website.
4.  Implement preprocessors (e.g., Gulp) for task automation and optimization of assets.
5.  Ensure the website is highly responsive, accessible, and compatible across various devices and browsers.
6.  Integrate an open source CMS platform (e.g., WordPress) to manage and maintain the content of the website, demonstrating your ability to work with open-source CMS solutions.
7.  Implement advanced GitFlow practices for version control, including feature branching, pull requests, code reviews, and release management.
8.  Provide clear and comprehensive documentation covering architectural decisions, code organization, and deployment instructions.

**Task 1: HTML/CSS/Javascript**

Create a responsive webpage with advanced features:

*   Use of an open source CMS of your choice (eg., Wordpress)
*   Header with navigation menu and advanced navigation patterns (e.g., mega menu, nested menus)
*   Develop a custom carousel/slider component using vanilla JavaScript or a lightweight library (not a pre-built carousel library).
*   Implement lazy loading for images in the carousel to optimize performance.
*   Implement a multi-step form with dynamic validation based on user input.
*   Include animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.
*   Use Flexbox or Grid for layout.
*   Create a testimonial section that fetches data from a mock API (you can use a service like JSON Placeholder) and displays the information on the webpage dynamically.
*   Your site will need to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Implement keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and other accessibility features.
*   Your site will need to adapt gracefully to various screen sizes (multiple break points) and orientations.
*   Implement advanced techniques such as fluid layouts, media queries, or viewport units.
*   Utilize SCSS/Sass for advanced styling and theming capabilities.
*   Utilize preprocessors (e.g., Gulp) for task automation and optimization of assets.

**Task 2: Advanced Frameworks/Libraries**

*   Utilize a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) to build a single-page application (SPA) for managing user profiles with the following features:
    *   User authentication and authorization.
    *   CRUD operations for user profiles (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    *   Use a state management solution (e.g., Redux, Vuex) to manage application state.
    *   Implement client-side routing to navigate between different views within the application.

**Task 3: Advanced Testing**

*   Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests for the components and functionality implemented in Task 3 using a testing framework of your choice (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library, Jasmine).
*   Ensure that the tests cover edge cases, asynchronous behavior (e.g., API requests), and error handling scenarios.

**Additional Requirements:**

*   Demonstrate a strong understanding of SEO and Web Accessibility standards, implementing best practices throughout the website.
*   Implement advanced GitFlow practices for version control, ensuring a seamless collaboration and release management process.
*   Provide comprehensive documentation covering architectural decisions, code organization, and deployment instructions.

**Evaluation Criteria:**  
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   Adherence to provided specifications and requirements, with a focus on leveraging advanced front end development techniques and technologies.
*   Quality and organization of HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript (ES6), and TypeScript code, emphasizing modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
*   Effective use of front end frameworks/libraries, preprocessors, and CMS platforms to streamline development and enhance user experience.
*   Mastery of advanced GitFlow practices for version control, including branching strategies, pull requests, code reviews, and release management.
*   Implementation of SEO and Web Accessibility standards, demonstrating your strong understanding of best practices.
*   Documentation quality, including comprehensive architectural explanations, code organization insights, and deployment instructions.
*   Overall design, usability, and visual appeal of the website, showcasing your creative vision and attention to detail.

**Submission:**

*   Provide a GitHub repository link containing your solution for Tasks 1, 2, and 3.
*   Include instructions for running the application, tests, and any required setup steps.
*   Optionally, provide detailed documentation or comments explaining your design decisions, architecture, and approach to testing.

If you have any questions or need further clarification on the requirements, please feel free to reach out. We look forward to reviewing your submission and discussing your qualifications in greater detail.
